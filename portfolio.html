      Make it Rain challenge from Khan Academy <br>
         <canvas id="mycanvas"></canvas>
        <br> I had fun doing this particular
        challenge. It was interesting to find out how to get random numbers and also make the whole thing update itself each time.

      <a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/_cCi8r2F0RFd0">Pet microbit</a>
      <br>Pet code made in the Makecode Block editor for the microbit assignement. We made a pet that changes its' mood based on different inputs. It has a different mood for each

        <p>p5.js clock</p>
        <iframe height="400px" width="400px" src="https://editor.p5js.org/chewsty/full/P9On0zshMj"></iframe>
        <br>Creative coding challenge coded along with one of the groups. I made some slight adjustments and some parts of the code look different from the original but it works.

      <li>
        <p>p5.js water ripple simulation</p>
        <iframe height="400px" width="400px" src="https://editor.p5js.org/chewsty/full/QLdovQvf6"></iframe>
        <br> Another one of the challenges done along with another group. This one was fun to make and it looks cool.
      </li>
      <li>Javascript game made for GameJam
      <br>Though a lot of struggle we managed to put together something that runs. It was not too fun to make, we had to give up on a lot of ideas. Also school wifi restrictions played a part.

      <li><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/chewsty/sketches/boFn1hH-0">p5.js img into ascii</a>
      <br>And another one of the challenges, this one was probably the most complicated one out of the ones I completed. It is, in some cases a useful tool.</li>
